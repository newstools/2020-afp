Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson returned from injury to lead the European champions as they seek to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday. The England international has been sidelined since injuring a hamstring in the first leg in Madrid three weeks ago and has been badly missed as Liverpool suffered their only Premier League defeat of the season so far at Watford and crashed out of the FA Cup to Chelsea. Andy Robertson also returns in the only other change from the side that started Saturday's 2-1 win over Bournemouth with Adrian once again deputising in goal for the injured Alisson Becker. Diego Costa starts up front for Atletico for the first time since November as Diego Simeone hopes to get the away goal that will force Liverpool to score at least three to progress. Club record $143 million signing Joao Felix also returns from the side that started the first leg.

Winger Damian Penaud will return from injury to replace Teddy Thomas for France's Six Nations visit to Scotland this weekend, head coach Fabien Galthie announced on Friday. Penaud, 23, has missed les Bleus' three opening victories in the tournament after suffering a calf injury before their February 2 victory over England. Thomas was substituted after 66 minutes during the win over Wales on February 22 and French newspaper L'Equipe gave him a 4 out of 10 rating for his performance in Cardiff. A fourth victory on Sunday ensures a tilt at a first Grand Slam for France since 2010. France (15-1) Anthony Bouthier; Damian Penaud, Virimi Vakatawa, Arthur Vincent, Gael Fickou; Romain Ntamack, Antoine Dupont; Gregory Alldritt, Charles Ollivon (capt), Francois Cros; Paul Willemse, Bernard Le Roux; Mohamed Haouas, Camille Chat, Jefferson Poirot Replacements: Camille Chat, Jean-Baptiste Gros, Demba Bamba, Romain Taofifenua, Dylan Cretin, Baptiste Serin, Matthieu Jalibert, Thomas Ramos

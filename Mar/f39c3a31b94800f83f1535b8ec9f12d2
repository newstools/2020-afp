Winger Damian Penaud will return from injury to replace Teddy Thomas for France's Six Nations visit to Scotland this weekend, head coach Fabien Galthie announced on Friday. Penaud, 23, has missed Les Bleus' three opening victories in the tournament after suffering a calf injury before their February 2 victory over England. Thomas was substituted after 66 minutes of the win over Wales on February 22 and Galthie opted not to include the Racing 92 winger in the squad that will travel to Edinburgh. "There are no sanctions with France, there's healthy competition. Thomas is still part of the squad," Galthie said. "Penaud came back to training before the third match, he has been excellent in training and made his claim for this fourth match," Galthie added. Elsewhere, prop Jefferson Poirot takes the place of Cyril Baille who sustained a shoulder injury at the Principality Stadium. A fourth victory in this tournament for France on Sunday would ensure a tilt at a first Grand Slam since 2010.

The Canadian Grand Prix, scheduled for Montreal June 12-14, has been postponed, the latest Formula One casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers of the event said in a statement on Tuesday that they "would have been honored to host the first race on the 2020 Formula 1 calendar" and they were "saddened" to have to postpone the race. The news followed the announcement that Formula One are working with promoters on a revised 2020 calendar, with officials hoping to launch a season that had already seen eight races either cancelled or postponed.

Honda plants in Brazil and India have halted operations as the Japanese carmaker battles to recover from a cyberattack that affected several factories worldwide. The cyberattack at the beginning of the week targeted Honda's internal servers and spread a virus through the company's systems, a spokeswoman told AFP on Wednesday. Motorcycle plants in India and Brazil were still out of action following the attack, while a four-wheel vehicle plant in Turkey resumed operations on Wednesday, the spokeswoman said. The firm was "still investigating details", she said. In total, the cyberattack affected 11 Honda plants -- including five in the US, according to local media reports. All US plants have resumed operations, the spokeswoman said, declining to elaborate further. She said the suspension would have only a limited impact on Honda's business globally. Global automakers including Honda have already been hit hard by a slump in sales because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, Honda reported a 25.3-percent fall in net profit from the previous year as sales dropped six percent to 14.9 trillion yen ($138 billion) in the fiscal year ending in March.

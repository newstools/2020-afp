Three days after turning 24, Bayern Munich's Kingsley Coman celebrated winning the ninth league title of his career. The France attacker clinched his fifth straight Bundesliga crown following the Bavarians' 1-0 victory at Werder Bremen to add his two Serie A successes and two Ligue 1 titles. Coman was an unused member of Paris Saint-Germain's squad as a 16-year-old in 2013 and played just once for Juventus three years later. In 2015-2016 he had two domestic top-flight titles after featuring for Juve before joining Bayern during the same campaign. He can claim a third German Cup win in July as Bayern face Bayer Leverkusen in this year's final in Berlin.

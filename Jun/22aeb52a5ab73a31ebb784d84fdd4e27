England scrum-half Ben Spencer has agreed to join Bath, with lock Will Spencer and prop Juan Schoeman also signing for the Premiership club for next season. Spencer, who enjoyed a five-minute cameo for England in last year's Rugby World Cup final against South Africa after being called up as a late replacement, is leaving relegated Saracens after almost a decade of service and has agreed a three-year deal at the Recreation Ground. The 27-year-old told the Saracens website: "I'm sad to be leaving a club that's been my life for nine years. "I'll treasure the memories that I've made at this club for the rest of my life. I leave with incredible memories." Will Spencer returns from Leicester for a second spell at the club he left in 2016 and Schoeman arrives from the Sharks in South Africa. All three will become Bath players when the 2020/21 season begins. Premiership Rugby on Friday said it was aiming to restart the current season on August 15 following the coronavirus lockdown. Josh Matavesi has been handed a two-year deal at Bath, having joined on temporary terms midway through the current campaign.

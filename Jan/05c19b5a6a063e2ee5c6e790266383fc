British pop star Rod Stewart has been charged for allegedly punching a hotel security guard in the chest outside a children's party in Florida, according to a police report obtained by US media. The 74-year-old singer of "Forever Young" and numerous other hits was with his family at The Breakers, a luxury hotel in Palm Beach, on New Year's Eve when he was refused access to a party in the children's section of the resort, US media reported on Friday. Stewart was attempting to enter the event with his 39-year-old son Sean and other family members including children, according to the police report. The singer -- recognizable by his hoarse voice and mop of blond hair -- was charged with simple battery, a minor offense which is generally punishable by a fine. His son reportedly faces the same charge. They are scheduled to appear in a Palm Beach court on February 5. Stewart, whose number-one hits included "Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)," released his 30th studio album in 2018. In December, he had the  number one Christmas album with "You're in My Heart," a collection of his classics with new backing from London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2016.

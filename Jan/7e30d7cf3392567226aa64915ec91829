Tottenham captain Hugo Lloris returned for his first appearance under Jose Mourinho against Norwich on Wednesday after over three months out with a dislocated elbow. The French number one suffered the injury in conceding the first goal of a dispiriting 3-0 defeat to Brighton in early October. Just over a month later, Mourinho replaced the sacked Mauricio Pochettino. The 32-year-old returned to training earlier this month, but was not expected to feature until early February. However, with Spurs badly in need of a win against the Canaries to boost their chances of a top-four Premier League finish, Mourinho dropped Paulo Gazzaniga to the bench, despite the Argentine saving a penalty in Saturday's 0-0 draw at Watford.

French club Racing 92 announced on Monday they had signed "premium" Australia utility back Kurtley Beale from the Waratahs on a two-year-deal. Beale, 31, who has scored 156 points in 92 Tests, will join Paris-based Racing next season along with compatriot Luke Jones, a second-row forward currently at the Rebels having previously played in the Top 14 with Bordeaux-Begles. "We've tried to mix youth and experience in positions where we haven't managed to pull through from our academy," sporting director Yannick Nyanga said. "We have two premium signings who will bring some experience and their ability," he added. Beale will add his free-flowing vision to an already flair-filled backline which includes influential fly-half Finn Russell as well as clinical wingers Simon Zebo and Teddy Thomas. Jones arrives as a replacement for Fiji's Leone Nakarawa, who was sacked in December after returning late from the Rugby World Cup. Tonga prop Ben Tameifuna and former France full-back Brice Dulin are among the players to leave the side while Fiji fly-half Ben Volavola will join second-tier Perpignan on a one-season loan deal. Former New Zealand back-rower Chris Masoe will leave his position as defence coach, to be replaced by ex-France hooker Dimitri Szarzewski. "He's very charming and has a strong connection with the club. We thank him for what he's done for the club and wish him the best for the future," head coach Laurent Travers said. The 2016 Bouclier de Brennus champions also said Scotland's Russell as well as France pair Boris Palu and Maxime Machenaud had extended their contracts. The French top-flight campaign was declared over in April and Travers said the club have a three-stage plan for starting next season which includes medical tests towards the beginning of July, two pre-season fixtures in August and the new term kicking off in September. "Everyone is eager to get back on the pitch with a ball in their hands," Travers said.

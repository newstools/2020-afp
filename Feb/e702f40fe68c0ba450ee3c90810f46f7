Simmons, of Melbourne, finished with 26 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists and American centre Joel Embiid had 26 points and nine rebounds for the Sixers, who extended their win streak to three straight.

Kawhi Leonard tallied 30 points and nine assists while Landry Shamet added 19 points and Marcus Morris and Lou Williams had 13 apiece for the visiting Clippers, who fell to 1-2 on their four-game road trip. Paul George finished with 11 points and 12 rebounds. The contest was tied 54-54 at halftime and the Sixers led 81-77 heading into the fourth quarter. Leonard led all scorers in the first half with 17 points. Simmons powered the Sixers with 16. With just over five minutes to go, Leonard scored a basket to cut the deficit to 99-94. Philadelphia immediately answered with a three-pointer from Richardson to push the lead back to eight points. Richardson then completed a three-point play, and the Philadelphia lead was 11 points with 3:37 remaining. The Clippers got within 109-100 with 81 seconds left after a three-point play by Leonard. Embiid and Morris received a double technical after a scuffle under the basket with 2:48 left.

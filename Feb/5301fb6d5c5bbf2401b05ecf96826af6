Canada's Vasek Pospisil, who stunned fans by sipping maple syrup during the Montpellier ATP final at the weekend, continued his impressive form Wednesday when he defeated top seed Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 6-3 at the Rotterdam tournament. Pospisil, a former top 30 player now ranked 104, saved six of seven break points as he clinched a seventh top 10 career victory. The 29-year-old Canadian made the final in Montpellier on Sunday where he lost to home star Gael Monfils. However, he caused a stir on social media when he was photographed drinking from a bottle of maple syrup, the emblematic drink of Canada. "Maple Syrup: Best Sports performance drink. Anti-cancerous properties. Rich in nutrients & minerals. Shockingly good in coffee. A great friend. You're Welcome, World," he tweeted earlier this week. Pospisil will face Serbia's Filip Krajinovic for a spot in the Rotterdam quarter-finals.

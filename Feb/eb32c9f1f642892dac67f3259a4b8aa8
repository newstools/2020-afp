Kyrie Irving channelled his inner "Mamba mentality" by torching Chicago for 54 points on Friday as the Brooklyn Nets crushed the Bulls 133-118 at Barclays Center. Irving's electrifying performance saw him shoot 19 of 23 from the field as he made his first 10 shots of the game before finishing it off with a dominating stretch in the fourth. "I hit a few shots in first half, so I just kept it going," Irving said. "The Kobe mentality, and Mamba mentality kept me going. It felt good." Irving also tied a season-high by making seven three-pointers on nine attempts for the Nets, who beat Chicago for the ninth time in the last 11 meetings. "I am just happy to be back playing the game I love. The most beautiful sound is just hearing these fans and having my family here," he said. Irving produced his second 50-point game this season and fourth of his career. He reached 50 points with a three-pointer that pushed the lead to 123-106 with 5:33 remaining. He closed out his night with 2:43 remaining to a standing ovation. It was the third-highest point total for Irving, and the eighth 50-point game in Nets' history. His career high was 57 points in 2015 with Cleveland. The Nets led 107-99 when Irving came back into the game with 9:14 remaining. He scored 10 straight Brooklyn points, hitting a jumper, a layup, a three-pointer and converting a three-point play to expand the lead to 117-103 with 7:43 remaining. Elsewhere, Pascal Siakam had 30 points, and the visiting Toronto Raptors stretched their winning streak to 10 games by cruising past the struggling Detroit Pistons 105-92. Serge Ibaka scored 21 points, and Fred VanVleet tallied 16 points, eight rebounds and nine assists for the Raptors, who made 51 percent of their shot attempts. Norman Powell led Toronto's reserves with 12 points, seven rebounds and three steals, and Chris Boucher chipped in eight points, seven rebounds in the win. Toronto centre Marc Gasol missed the game with a hamstring injury.
